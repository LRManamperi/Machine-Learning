"""# Quick tour

Get up and running with 🤗 Transformers! Whether you're a developer or an everyday user, this quick tour will help you get started and show you how to use the [pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) for inference, load a pretrained model and preprocessor with an [AutoClass](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/./model_doc/auto), and quickly train a model with PyTorch or TensorFlow. If you're a beginner, we recommend checking out our tutorials or [course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1) next for more in-depth explanations of the concepts introduced here.

Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
!pip install transformers datasets
```

You'll also need to install your preferred machine learning framework:

```bash
pip install torch
```
```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

Start by creating an instance of [pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) and specifying a task you want to use it for. In this guide, you'll use the [pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) for sentiment analysis as an example:
"""

from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

"""The [pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) downloads and caches a default [pretrained model](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) and tokenizer for sentiment analysis. Now you can use the `classifier` on your target text:"""

classifier("We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library.")

"""If you have more than one input, pass your inputs as a list to the [pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) to return a list of dictionaries:"""

for result in results:
    print(f"label: {result['label']}, with score: {round(result['score'], 4)}")

"""The [pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) can also iterate over an entire dataset for any task you like. For this example, let's choose automatic speech recognition as our task:"""

from datasets import load_dataset, Audio

dataset = load_dataset("PolyAI/minds14", name="en-US", split="train")

"""You need to make sure the sampling rate of the dataset matches the sampling

### Use another model and tokenizer in the pipeline

The [pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) can accommodate any model from the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models), making it easy to adapt the [pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) for other use-cases. For example, if you'd like a model capable of handling French text, use the tags on the Hub to filter for an appropriate model. The top filtered result returns a multilingual [BERT model](https://huggingface.co/nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment) finetuned for sentiment analysis you can use for French text:
"""

"""Under the hood, the [AutoModelForSequenceClassification](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification) and [AutoTokenizer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer) classes work together to power the [pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) you used above. An [AutoClass](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/./model_doc/auto) is a shortcut that automatically retrieves the architecture of a pretrained model from its name or path. You only need to select the appropriate `AutoClass` for your task and it's associated preprocessing class.

Let's return to the example from the previous section and see how you can use the `AutoClass` to replicate the results of the [pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline).

### AutoTokenizer

A tokenizer is responsible for preprocessing text into an array of numbers as inputs to a model. There are multiple rules that govern the tokenization process, including how to split a word and at what level words should be split (learn more about tokenization in the [tokenizer summary](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/./tokenizer_summary)). The most important thing to remember is you need to instantiate a tokenizer with the same model name to ensure you're using the same tokenization rules a model was pretrained with.

Load a tokenizer with [AutoTokenizer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer):
"""

from transformers import AutoTokenizer

model_name = "nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

"""Pass your text to the tokenizer:"""

encoding = tokenizer("We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library.")
print(encoding)

"""The tokenizer returns a dictionary containing:

* [input_ids](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/./glossary#input-ids): numerical representations of your tokens.
* [attention_mask](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/.glossary#attention-mask): indicates which tokens should be attended to.

A tokenizer can also accept a list of inputs, and pad and truncate the text to return a batch with uniform length:
"""

pt_batch = tokenizer(
    ["We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library.", "We hope you don't hate it."],
    padding=True,
    truncation=True,
    max_length=512,
    return_tensors="pt",
)

tf_batch = tokenizer(
    ["We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library.", "We hope you don't hate it."],
    padding=True,
    truncation=True,
    max_length=512,
    return_tensors="tf",
)

"""<Tip>

Check out the [preprocess](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/./preprocessing) tutorial for more details about tokenization, and how to use an [AutoImageProcessor](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoImageProcessor), [AutoFeatureExtractor](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoFeatureExtractor) and [AutoProcessor](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoProcessor) to preprocess image, audio, and multimodal inputs.

</Tip>

### AutoModel

🤗 Transformers provides a simple and unified way to load pretrained instances. This means you can load an [AutoModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModel) like you would load an [AutoTokenizer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). The only difference is selecting the correct [AutoModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModel) for the task. For text (or sequence) classification, you should load [AutoModelForSequenceClassification](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification):
"""

from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

model_name = "nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment"

</Tip>

Now pass your preprocessed batch of inputs directly to the model. You just have to unpack the dictionary by adding `**`:
"""

pt_outputs = pt_model(**pt_batch)

"""The model outputs the final activations in the `logits` attribute. Apply the softmax function to the `logits` to retrieve the probabilities:"""

tf_predictions

"""<Tip>

All 🤗 Transformers models (PyTorch or TensorFlow) output the tensors *before* the final activation
function (like softmax) because the final activation function is often fused with the loss. Model outputs are special dataclasses so their attributes are autocompleted in an IDE. The model outputs behave like a tuple or a dictionary (you can index with an integer, a slice or a string) in which case, attributes that are None are ignored.

</Tip>

### Save a model

tf_model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(pt_save_directory, from_pt=True)

"""## Custom model builds

You start from scratch when you initialize a model from a custom configuration class. The model attributes are randomly initialized, and you'll need to train the model before you can use it to get meaningful results.

## Trainer - a PyTorch optimized training loop

All models are a standard [`torch.nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) so you can use them in any typical training loop. While you can write your own training loop, 🤗 Transformers provides a [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) class for PyTorch, which contains the basic training loop and adds additional functionality for features like distributed training, mixed precision, and more.

Depending on your task, you'll typically pass the following parameters to [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer):

1. A [PreTrainedModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel) or a [`torch.nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module):

   ```py
   >>> from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

   >>> model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
   ```

2. [TrainingArguments](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments) contains the model hyperparameters you can change like learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs to train for. The default values are used if you don't specify any training arguments:

   ```py
   >>> from transformers import TrainingArguments

   >>> training_args = TrainingArguments(
   ...     output_dir="path/to/save/folder/",
   ...     learning_rate=2e-5,
   ...     per_device_train_batch_size=8,
   ...     per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
   ...     num_train_epochs=2,
   ... )
   ```

3. A preprocessing class like a tokenizer, image processor, feature extractor, or processor:

   ```py
   >>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer

   >>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
   ```

4. Load a dataset:

   ```py
   >>> from datasets import load_dataset

   >>> dataset = load_dataset("rotten_tomatoes")  # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT
   ```

5. Create a function to tokenize the dataset:

   ```py
   >>> def tokenize_dataset(dataset):
   ...     return tokenizer(dataset["text"])
   ```

   Then apply it over the entire dataset with [map](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/main/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset.map):

   ```py
   >>> dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_dataset, batched=True)
   ```

6. A [DataCollatorWithPadding](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/data_collator#transformers.DataCollatorWithPadding) to create a batch of examples from your dataset:

   ```py
   >>> from transformers import DataCollatorWithPadding

   >>> data_collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer=tokenizer)
   ```

Now gather all these classes in [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer):
"""

from transformers import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=dataset["test"],
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=data_collator,
)  # doctest: +SKIP

"""When you're ready, call [train()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer.train) to start training:"""

trainer.train()

"""<Tip>

For tasks - like translation or summarization - that use a sequence-to-sequence model, use the [Seq2SeqTrainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Seq2SeqTrainer) and [Seq2SeqTrainingArguments](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Seq2SeqTrainingArguments) classes instead.

</Tip>

You can customize the training loop behavior by subclassing the methods inside [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer). This allows you to customize features such as the loss function, optimizer, and scheduler. Take a look at the [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) reference for which methods can be subclassed.

The other way to customize the training loop is by using [Callbacks](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/./main_classes/callbacks). You can use callbacks to integrate with other libraries and inspect the training loop to report on progress or stop the training early. Callbacks do not modify anything in the training loop itself. To customize something like the loss function, you need to subclass the [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) instead.

## Train with TensorFlow

All models are a standard [`tf.keras.Model`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) so they can be trained in TensorFlow with the [Keras](https://keras.io/) API. 🤗 Transformers provides the [prepare_tf_dataset()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel.prepare_tf_dataset) method to easily load your dataset as a `tf.data.Dataset` so you can start training right away with Keras' [`compile`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#compile-method) and [`fit`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#fit-method) methods.

1. You'll start with a [TFPreTrainedModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel) or a [`tf.keras.Model`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model):

   ```py
   >>> from transformers import TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification

   >>> model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
   ```

2. A preprocessing class like a tokenizer, image processor, feature extractor, or processor:

   ```py
   >>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer

   >>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
   ```

3. Create a function to tokenize the dataset:

   ```py
   >>> def tokenize_dataset(dataset):
   ...     return tokenizer(dataset["text"])  # doctest: +SKIP
   ```

4. Apply the tokenizer over the entire dataset with [map](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/main/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset.map) and then pass the dataset and tokenizer to [prepare_tf_dataset()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel.prepare_tf_dataset). You can also change the batch size and shuffle the dataset here if you'd like:

   ```py
   >>> dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_dataset)  # doctest: +SKIP
   >>> tf_dataset = model.prepare_tf_dataset(
   ...     dataset["train"], batch_size=16, shuffle=True, tokenizer=tokenizer
   ... )  # doctest: +SKIP
   ```

5. When you're ready, you can call `compile` and `fit` to start training. Note that Transformers models all have a default task-relevant loss function, so you don't need to specify one unless you want to:

   ```py
   >>> from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

   >>> model.compile(optimizer=Adam(3e-5))  # No loss argument!
   >>> model.fit(tf_dataset)  # doctest: +SKIP
   ```
